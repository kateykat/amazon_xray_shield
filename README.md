# Amazon Xray Shield

This extension removes the x-ray feature from Amazon Prime Video within 10 seconds of the video starting and keeps it off until the page is refreshed.  For those who want to enjoy a video without that annoying popup.

Note that if it does not work, hard refresh your page (control + shift + r) and wait 10 seconds.
